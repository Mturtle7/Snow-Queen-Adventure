Snow Queen Adventure Game

Began as a simple first project for my online Python class (offered by UC Berkeley), grew in scope and fun until I decided to keep developing it beyond the basic stage, hopefully into a complete, playable adventure game soon.

All descriptions either copied from or directly inspired by Hans Christian Anderson's "The Snow Queen" fairy Tale, as published on http://hca.gilead.org.il/snow_que.html
